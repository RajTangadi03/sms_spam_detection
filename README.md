# SMS Spam Detection Algorithm

This project implements an SMS spam detection algorithm using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify SMS messages as either "spam" (unsolicited or malicious messages) or "ham" (non-spam, legitimate messages).

## Overview

The algorithm uses a variety of machine learning methods to detect spam messages. It works by first processing a dataset of labeled SMS messages (containing both spam and ham labels). The messages undergo preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, tokenization, and stop word removal to prepare the data for model training.

Next, features are extracted from the cleaned text data, typically using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or bag-of-words. These features help the model understand the content of the messages. A machine learning classifier (such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, or Random Forest) is then trained on the dataset to recognize patterns in the text and predict whether a message is spam or ham.

The model is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to ensure its effectiveness in detecting spam messages.
